## Color Explorer

This small script was borne out of a curiosity of what certain colors in images are. I thought it'd be nice to add a point-and-click interface that would return the hex value of the color based on pixel location. To get started, upload an image via the file uploader. The bitmap underneath will show (in white) where the color value is being used in the image provided.
